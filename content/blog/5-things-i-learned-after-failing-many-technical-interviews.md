## Summary
1. Your most recent or strongest language may not be the best language to do an interview.
1. Get your code compiling / working first, test and optimize later.
1. Do LeetCode-type questions and lots of it.
1. Have a breadth of knowledge over depth of knowledge.
1. Show leadership traits.

Over the years, I have encountered many interviews, and found ways to improve myself in the software developer interview process. Here are 5 things that you may want to think about the next time you land a technical interview:

### 1. Your most recent or strongest language may not be the best language to do an interview
Prior to getting hired at my current company, I had experience working with PHP, C#, JavaScript and Python. What language did I choose to do my technical interviews? The answer is Java. I was solely a PHP developer, and I haven’t touched Java since college. So why did I not choose PHP or any of the languages that I listed? The answer may not be so obvious, but I chose Java for its readable errors. When you’re coding on the fly, mistakes will happen, and errors will come up. I have had nothing but problems doing my technical test with PHP, which led me to multiple rejections. I lost a lot of time going line-by-line to debug the issue, just because PHP would throw errors that are far too generic. Choose a language that you can easily work with.

### 2. Get your code compiling / working first, test and optimize later
There were many times where I would say to the interviewer “Hmm. Not sure what’s wrong with my code. I know my logic is correct”. What would go through your mind if you were the interviewer? You would most likely raise a red flag and probably not be impressed. As a candidate for the role, give yourself some time to think about the algorithm and ask questions to clarify information with your interviewer. A bad performing algorithm is still far better than a non-working solution. Once you have a working solution, you can start testing your code and start tweaking your code. If time permits, start optimizing your solution. The best-case scenario, of course, is to have an optimized working solution.

### 3. Do LeetCode-type questions and lots of it
Don’t believe in the myth that LeetCode is a waste of time. It is true that the interview process is completely different from the actual work you do. It is true that a lot of companies will not utilize many computer science related concepts and fundamentals. However, it's the norm for a reason. Interviewers are trying to understand how you think, how you approach a problem and how well you work under pressure. Ultimately, the interviewer will be wondering if you are able to work individually with minimal supervision. I find the best LeetCodes are the timed interview simulation (Paid Premium Content).

### 4. Have a breadth of knowledge over depth
I believe great developers are not necessarily an expert in one area or one language, but rather a great developer is one who can solve problems, regardless of the tech stack. In the software development space, it’s important to be able to adapt to new technology quickly. If I were to choose a language to learn for the rest of my life, I’d love to be a full-time C programmer. Unfortunately, the job market does not fair well for C-developers, and it would be very difficult to find a C-specific role. As such, it is important to remember a wide array of topic, such as big-O’s, data structures, algorithms, and system design knowledge. Donne Martin has an incredible repository for system design related content [https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/blob/master/README.md). Expect the interviewer will throw curve balls at you, so it's better to be prepared for any and all types of interview questions. Remember, interviewers are looking for problem solvers.

### 5. Show leadership traits
This may sound like a cliché and not exactly a stereotypical software developer characteristic. But a good number of companies are looking for long-term employees who are willing to grow within the company. Hiring is very expensive, and companies do not appreciate a high churn rate. There are many attributes that separates a good developer from a great developer, but one attribute stands out from the rest. You show that you are accountable and responsible. You look after one another and you respect your fellow developers. If you’ve had the opportunity to work with a tech lead or a developer you get along with, chances are they are developers who take accountability and responsibilities for their actions. They are some of the smartest people you’ve ever met, yet they are people you can get along with easily.

I have applied to many jobs over the years and was rejected by the majority of them. I have written multiple variations of resumes and cover letters, yet I only landed a small fraction of technical interviews. If you feel like you are getting turned down over and over again, remember that you are not the only one. Overall, it’s a constant learning experience and constant practice. I look at failure as a lesson learned and a win rather than a loss.
